**Build** is the result automatically compiled through Action (only executable files).  
The result may be unstable or even have serious vulnerabilities.  
Please use it with caution; 
Of course, in most cases you can use the Build version to try something new.  
After you obtain the files of Build version, you need to replace the executable files in the original software package of Yolang (named "yolang", and the suffix depends on the system)
